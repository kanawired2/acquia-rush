INTRODUCTION
------------

This module is intended to get you up and running with Smart Date for managing
events. As a starter kit, it defines a simple Event content type, which uses a
Smart Date field to specify start and end times. It also provides an Events
view, including tabs for lists of upcoming and past events.


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install the Smart Date module as you would normally install a
   contributed Drupal module. Visit
   https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further information.
 * Then, install the Smart Date Starter Kit module. This will import
   configuration. Once installed, the module doesn't really provide any
   additional functionality, so it can be uninstalled. Note that you won't be
   able to install it again on the same site, unless you delete the Event
   content type and Events view that were installed originally.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the Smart Date module.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

 * There isn't really any specific configuration per se, but in all
   likelihood you'll want to add additional fields to the Event content type
   (for example, to indicate a location). Similarly, it's likely you'll want
   to add to the Events view.
